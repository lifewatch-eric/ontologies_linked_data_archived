comment: To accommodate unicellular organisms better, 'cell in vivo' has been re-labeled 'native cell' to better represent its intended meaning - that is, that it is a cell in the context of a multicellular organism or in a natural environment. 'Native' is intended to contrast with 'in vitro', which refers to cells or other biological entities that have been intentionally placed in a controlled, non-natural setting for the purpose of study or manipulation.

comment: Commonly, the cleithrum is a large, well-ossified bone provided with a dorsal and a ventral arm that form an angle of about 90 or a few more degrees. The dorsal arm may end in a sharp or spine-like process to articulate with the supracleithrum. At the confluence of both arms the bone presents a blade extending postero-ventrally and that may have different development among fishes. The anterior edge of the cleithrum is usually thick and may produce a medial plate of different degrees of development.

comment: Although the branchiostegals are articulated or attached to the hyoid arch, they belong to the opercular series. Branchiostegal rays are of variable shape and number and their homology is problematic. Usually they are numbered from anterior to posterior elements, instead from posterior to anteriorly considering that the last element of the series is consistently associated to the subopercle. For a survey of branchiostegal rays see Mc Allister (1968).

comment: The cartilaginous autopalatine forms from the anterior palatoquadrate arch. Possession of a dorsomedial process, which abuts the ethmoid, is a unique feature shared by Cypriniformes (Fink and Fink, 1981). The palatine has two components, the autopalatine (derived from pars autopalatine) and the dermal component having teeth, the dermopalatine Arratia & Schultze 1990. The element in cypriniforms is only the cartilage part, so that it is more correct to name it autopalatine and not as palatine in general that it implies a fusion of elements (as in perciforms).

comment: The quadrate commonly has a triangular shape, with its lower vertex, or condyle, for articulation with the lower jaw, and an elongate postero-ventral or postero-dorsal elongate process. The presence of an elongate postero-ventral or postero-dorsal process is a synapomorphy of teleosts (Arratia and Schultze, 1990; Arratia, 1999).

comment: The term preural vertebra was created by Nybelin (1963) for those vertebrae supporting caudal procurrent rays. For additional information see Arratia and Schultze (1992). Their neural and hemal arches may or may not be fused to their corresponding autocentrum. Fusion or separation of certain neural and/or haemal arches of preural centra is characteristic or certain teleosts subgroup. The boundary between preural and ural region is determined by the bifurcation of the four or five blood vessels running inside the hemal arches of the preural vertebrae (primary caudal artery, two secondary arterial trunks, primary caudal vein, and secondary subvertebral vein) (for details see Schultze & Arratia, 1989). The bifurcation of the caudal artery and vein was proposed as a landmark to homologize preural centrum 1 throughout actinopterygians (Nybelin, 1963).

comment: Counts of caudal principal rays are taken as the number of branched rays plus two adjacent unbranched rays and counts are typically reported as, for example: 1,8,7,1 (1 unbranched and 8 branched upper rays, 7 branched and 1 unbranched lower rays). A caudal principal caudal ray may be associated with one or more hypurals or with hemal spines of preural centra 1 and 2 (Schultze and Arratia, 1989; Arratia, 2008). In basal teleosts the number of caudal principal rays is about 20.

A decreasing of the number of the branched-and segmented rays is observed in more advanced teleosts (see Schultze and Arratia, 1989; Arratia, 1991, 2008). The presence of marginal principal caudal rays as long or longer than the branched-and-segmented principal rays is a synapomorphy of teleosts (Arratia, 2008, 2009).

def: "A cell capable of processing and presenting lipid and protein antigens to T cells in order to initiate an immune response." [ZFIN:ZDB-PUB-070221-3]
comment: Note change of name; nearly all somatic cells can present antigens to T cells via MHC Class I complexes leading to effector responses, but professional antigen presenting cells constituitively express MHC Class II as well as constimulatory molecules, and thus can initiate immune responses via T cells.

def: "For continuants: C part_of C' if and only if: given any c that instantiates C at a time t, there is some c' such that c' instantiates C' at time t, and c *part_of* c' at t. For processes: P part_of P' if and only if: given any p that instantiates P at a time t, there is some p' such that p' instantiates P' at time t, and p *part_of* p' at t. (Here *part_of* is the instance-level part-relation.)" [PMID:15892874]
comment: Parthood as a relation between instances: The primitive instance-level relation p part_of p1 is illustrated in assertions such as: this instance of rhodopsin mediated phototransduction part_of this instance of visual perception.    This relation satisfies at least the following standard axioms of mereology: reflexivity (for all p, p part_of p); anti-symmetry (for all p, p1, if p part_of p1 and p1 part_of p then p and p1 are identical); and transitivity (for all p, p1, p2, if p part_of p1 and p1 part_of p2, then p part_of p2). Analogous axioms hold also for parthood as a relation between spatial regions.    For parthood as a relation between continuants, these axioms need to be modified to take account of the incorporation of a temporal argument. Thus for example the axiom of transitivity for continuants will assert that if c part_of c1 at t and c1 part_of c2 at t, then also c part_of c2 at t.    Parthood as a relation between classes: To define part_of as a relation between classes we again need to distinguish the two cases of continuants and processes, even though the explicit reference to instants of time now falls away. For continuants, we have C part_of C1 if and only if any instance of C at any time is an instance-level part of some instance of C1 at that time, as for example in: cell nucleus part_ of cell.

[PMID:15892874]
comment: When an embryonic oenocyte (a type of insect cell) is transformed into a larval oenocyte, one and the same continuant entity preserves its identity while instantiating distinct classes at distinct times. The class-level relation transformation_of obtains between continuant classes C and C1 wherever each instance of the class C is such as to have existed at some earlier time as an instance of the distinct class C1 (see Figure 2 in paper). This relation is illustrated first of all at the molecular level of granularity by the relation between mature RNA and the pre-RNA from which it is processed, or between (UV-induced) thymine-dimer and thymine dinucleotide. At coarser levels of granularity it is illustrated by the transformations involved in the creation of red blood cells, for example, from reticulocyte to erythrocyte, and by processes of development, for example, from larva to pupa, or from (post-gastrular) embryo to fetus or from child to adult. It is also manifest in pathological transformations, for example, of normal colon into carcinomatous colon. In each such case, one and the same continuant entity instantiates distinct classes at different times in virtue of phenotypic changes.
